# Grocery List

This is a demo project for a grocery list. This list was made with Vanilla JavaScript and the styling with CSS flexbox.

The list is an ordered list and:

1. You can add a new item to the list by clicking the shopping cart button or pressing the Enter key.
2. The new item can not be an empty string and in that case nothing happens.
3. You can delete an item from the list by clicking the trash button. A smooth animation is triggered
when this action happens.
4. You can toggle the cross out event to an item to indicate that this item was purchased by clicking the check button.
5. Date is also added at the top of the list and shows the current date.
6. Local storage functionality is also added so when you refresh the page the previous list is shown.
